      <h1>About Wingman</h1>

      <p>Wingman for Haskell automates away the old <a
          href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/typeholes/">hole-driven
          design</a> workflow. You probably know the one &mdash;  where you put
        down a hole, and ask the compiler what type it has. After a little bit
        of thinking, you add a little bit of code around the hole, and then ask
        the compiler again.  Over time, the expression gets written, but it
        seems like the compiler is doing most of the work. Sometimes it can
        feel like all you're around for is to write down what the compiler
        says.</p>

      <p>Instead, imagine a world where you can just ask "hey, fill in this
        hole for me, please." Wingman is that world. A typechecker is nothing
        but a series of rules that determine what type an expression has. By
        running these rules backwards, we can instead look at what expressions
        could produce a certain type. Search through a few thousand well-typed
        expessions, score them, and give back the best one.</p>

      <p>As you might expect, running the search is the easy part. Keeping it
        fast and making sure it returns good results is where the challenge comes
        in. And often, these goals are in tension. Always returning
        <code>undefined</code> would certainly be well-typed and fast, but it's
        clearly not what you had in mind.</p>

      <p>Wingman tries really hard to write the code you would have written
        youself. It prefers linear solutions, ensures productive recursion, and
        has a reasonable knowledge of common Haskell idioms &mdash; including
        eta-reduction and every-day combinators.</p>

      <p>Of course, sometimes human ingenuity is necessary to get a function
        out the door, and no automated tool can do the job. Even when you're not
        asking Wingman to fill holes for you, it can still help. By running
        small pices of the code synthesizer, it can perform case splits,
        introduce lambdas and, in general, help move you closer to the
        important part of the problem.</p>
